Throughout my academic journey, I have been immensely fortunate to cross paths with exceptional professors who have played pivotal roles in shaping my growth and fostering my passion for learning. 

As I look back on the moments that have brought me to where I am today, I am filled with deep appreciation for the professors who have generously shared their knowledge and wisdom with me. 

In this post you will find some of them. I encourage you to explore their work and accomplishments.
