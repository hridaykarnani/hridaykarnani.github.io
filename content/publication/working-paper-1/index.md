abstract: We explore how excessive stock correlation can be partially explained by informational linkages. We develop a simple model where agents overweight the precision of new information towards common factors due to their limited attention capability. This induces correlated errors in agents’ beliefs. We call this the informational channel and propose a novel measure for informational linkages between firms based on analysts forecast errors, we estimate how relevant it is with a Spatial-Two-Stage-Least-Square (S2SLS). We find that the informational channel is statistically significant, positive and varies (i) during crises, (ii) if the firm has been on the S\&P 500, (iii) if firms are in the same industry, (iv) if they are geographically nearby.
